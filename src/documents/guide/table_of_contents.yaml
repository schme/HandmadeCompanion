    description: >
        Before starting Handmade Hero, I did a five-day
        series on C programming to test the Twitch streaming
        set up.  It is too brief to be a complete introduction
        to C, but may be better than nothing if you are trying
        to start from scratch.  At some point, when there is
        time, I may try to do a more complete intro series for
        people who want to follow Handmade Hero but have little
        or no programming experience.

        The first week of Handmade Hero was spent setting up a
        Windows build, creating a window, and making it so that
        we could directly write animating graphics into a framebuffer
        and have Windows display it in our window.
