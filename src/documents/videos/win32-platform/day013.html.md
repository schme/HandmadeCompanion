    "1:06:55": "Beginning of Q&A"
    "1:07:05": "When normalizing the thumbstick value, is it worse to just add 32768 then multiply it by 2/65535 then subtract 1? I don't like the necessary if statement personally."
    "1:08:45": "Nitpick, but is it a bit misleading that the half transition count is zero or one, rather than an actual count?"
    "1:09:17": "Will we be completely ignoring platform code for most of the rest of the series?"
    "1:09:48": "Can you describe the struct inside of the union in more detail?"
    "1:13:37": "Does it give any problems with capturing inputs over time when, due to some circumstances from Windows, the game lags and the frame timebase expands?"
    "1:16:03": "Your normalizing code has an error, they both divide by positive."
    "1:17:53": "What happens if there's a name conflict between struct scope and a non-nested struct?"
    "1:18:35": "Do you plan on abstracting the input more. For example, instead of having a player respond to a button press, have them respond to an action that is bound to a button or stick?"
    "1:20:01": "Why is GameUpdateAndRender() internal when it's designed to be called from the platform layer?"
    "1:20:35": "Comment about using re-bindable keys and buttons for left-handed people."
    "1:21:17": "When will you decide to actually remove all the TODOs in your code?"
    "1:21:51": "Aside about rebindable keys."
    "1:23:01": "How is the old controller persisted across frames?"
    "1:23:59": "Will the Windows callbacks for keyboard inputs require a great deal of extra work for you to implement?"
    "1:25:18": "What about people who only have left arms?"
    "1:25:45": "Will we eventually be using a timer to poll the controller input, or just a thread?"
    "1:26:40": "timeBeginPeriod(1) will tick at 1 millisecond resolution."
    "1:27:37": "Have you done much physics coding, related to games or otherwise?"
    "1:28:25": "Would you be fine with people using the platform as a base for making their own games, with attribution?"
    "1:29:49": "How much will you need to explore other platforms before knowing what the abstraction API will look like?"
    "1:30:26": "What kinds of numerical methods are used in game physics?"
    "1:31:26": "Final Wrap Up"
