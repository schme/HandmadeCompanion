    "1:24:02": "Question: Is the process roughly the same for doing the Linux equivalent of sharing libraries?"
    "1:25:42": "Question: Your #define typedef magic kinda bugs me, in that it hides the arguments/return type away from the implementation. How much of a win is having the signature in one place?"
    "1:26:54": "Question: How does Windows manage memory in a dll? Is there a dll process page? Where are variables made/the statics stored? How is heap managed when allocated from a dll?"
    "1:37:14": "Question: Doesn't Windows know [who called it] by the instruction pointers leading up to the VirtualAlloc() call?"
