    "1:01:08": "Question: If we are locking the frame rate. Would that not mean that someone with a lower end computer, would have a slower game speed to others"

    "1:16:52": "Question: Wouldn't you want to fill the screen buffer before you hit the flip point, so it can grab the screen at the flip point"

    "1:18:41": "Question: What do you think about having a fixed physics time unconnected to the drawn frame time"
    "1:20:00": "Question: Any time you compute a world update should that not just set something that says if we get there early then wait."
