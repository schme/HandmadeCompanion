    "1:12:55": "Are you going to keep the sound buffer allocation seperate?"
    "1:13:14": "Why didn't you use libc's assert macro?"
    "1:13:43": "You're assert has issues."
    "1:14:37": "Why did you pick a BaseAddress so high up (2TB)?"

    "1:21:04": "Are there any guidelines for choosing a safe BaseAddress?"
    "1:21:46": "What happens if the user doesn't have enough RAM?"
    "1:22:40": "Isn't worrying about not having enough memory silly?"
    "1:23:25": "Why are you using pools instead of static allocation?"
    "1:23:52": "What mechanism will we use to assign memory out of our pools?"
    "1:24:17": "Having Q&A after the episode is like code review. Was that your intent?"
    "1:25:16": "What about i.e. modding support? You can't tell in advance if you've allowed enough memory for someone else's mod."
    "1:26:34": "Will our 64-bit allocation break on Raspberry Pi?"
    "1:27:27": "Will the Transient storage be freed, or will you just take off its end until its gone?"
    "1:27:45": "Is it better to keep track of how much memory is freed instead of total size?"
    "1:28:06": "Why are you reluctant to have to constants be 64-bit integers?"
    "1:29:27": "Did you pass different flags to VirtualAlloc for permanent and transient storage?"
    "1:29:54": "What are the 'other reasons' for specifying a BaseAddress."
    "1:31:01": "Is it possible the pool will be fragmented?"
