    "59:20": "Q&A"
    "59:44": "Perfect pitch would sell that!"
    "1:00:58": "I missed the part where you handled the endianness of the file, or are bitmaps always the same?"
    "1:01:56": "Do you prefer #pragma pack or gcc-like annotation?"
    "1:02:28": "What's your threshold for number of function parameters before putting them into a single structure?"
    "1:03:17": "Could you please describe how the sparse tilemap storage is done so far?"
    "1:11:13": "Why not use a function template to read raw bytes into any struct you cook up, one primitive at a time, instead of compiler annotations?"
    "1:14:59": "How will we handle memory when reading files? Would it be wasteful to read into our memory pool, then only use part of it?"
    "1:16:41": "Could you explain how to handle platform specific data?"
    "1:19:56": "Would it be easy to implement a generic sparse array to solve our tilemap problem (possibly overloading)?"
    "1:21:02": "So we have world chunks and -tiles, didn't we also have screens?"
    "1:21:45": "Why wouldn't you use a function template in the example mentioned before?"
    "1:27:11": "Will you write asset exporters/importers to get the assets into an efficient format or will you rely on the asset creators tools?"
